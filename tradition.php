                        Tunisian weddings are a celebration of love, family, and culture. They are typically large events that 
                        involve multiple days of feasting, dancing, and music. One of the most important parts of the wedding is 
                        the henna ceremony, during which the bride's hands and feet are decorated with intricate henna designs 
                        that symbolize fertility, good luck, and protection from evil.

                    <p class="text-article">
                        Tunisians take their coffee seriously, and it is an essential part of their daily routine. Coffee is 
                        not only a source of caffeine but also a symbol of hospitality, friendship, and respect. Traditional 
                        Tunisian coffee is strong, sweet, and served in small cups with dates or other sweets.

                        Tunisian cuisine is a fusion of Mediterranean, North African, and Middle Eastern flavors and ingredients. 
                        Some of the most popular dishes include couscous, brik (a fried pastry filled with egg and tuna), tajine 
                        (a slow-cooked stew), and mechouia (a roasted vegetable salad). Tunisian food is known for its bold 
                        flavors, aromatic spices, and use of local ingredients such as olives, dates, and harissa.

                        Ramadan is a month-long observance during which Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset. It is an important 
                        part of Tunisian culture and involves communal gatherings for breaking the fast, known as iftar. 
                        Tunisians prepare special foods and sweets for Ramadan, such as harissa soup, brik, and makroudh 
                        (a date-filled pastry). The month of Ramadan is also a time for spiritual reflection and devotion, 
                        with increased prayer and acts of charity.
