        <b>Good design techniques:</b>  The site is easy to navigate, it is simplistic and uses a color palette which is comprised of 
        pastelle-ish colors which are very easy on the eyes. Fonts fit the theme, decorative fonts are used minimally, fonts 
        for navigation bar and content are easy to read. <br><br>

        <b>Organization of information:</b> Information is well organized, every piece of information falls into it's prospective 
        site, which is easy to find because the categories are well sorted. <br><br>

        <b>Content:</b> There is a lot of content, which I find interesting, and would love to read if I was the user of the site. 
        Grammar and spelling have been proof read and checked, there are no spelling mistakes and no grammatical errors. <br><br>

        <b>Navigation:</b> Navigation bar is easy to use, straight-forward. When the user hovers over a link a nice hover animation 
        appears, on the left is a title of the page so the user knows exactly which page they are on. When viewed on smaller 
        screens, navbar resizes accordingly and still shows the user all the needed information. <br><br>

        <b>Use of HTML5 and CSS3 (and JS):</b> HTML and CSS have been checked via online validators, they have been used in a way so 
        any other programmer could look at the code and understand what the intentions were. The classes are clearly defined, 
        and the code is structured well. Code is commented so it is easily understood what the purpose of it is.<br><br>
            
        <b>Reference page:</b> Reference page is separately linked like asked. All information and images gotten from the internet 
        are properly cited using the APA7 citation style and displayed on the page in an organized fashion. <br><br>

        <b>Documentation/grading page:</b> Grading page is separately linked like asked. Code has been documented using comments, all 
        other important information is listed here.
